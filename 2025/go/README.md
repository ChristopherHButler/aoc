# AoC 2025 - Go edition

This is a Go implementation of Advent of Code 2025.

## About

 - `main.go` is the entry point to the program which allows you to run all the puzzle solvers.

 - Puzzle solvers are implemented as Go structs

 - Just about every day's puzzle relies on the `DataFileReader` util.


## Getting started

 - Copy the `boilerplate.go` file and rename both the file and struct it to something like `dec01.go`
<br />

 - Add a call to the solver in the `main.go` file.

1. Install dependencies:

```sh

```

2. Run the entry script:

```sh
go run main.go
```

## Running the puzzle solvers

The interface for each puzzle looks like this:

 ```go
type Puzzle struct {
	SolvePart1 func(date string, useTestData bool)
	SolvePart2 func(date string, useTestData bool)
}
 ```

Go does not support default values or optional parameters so all parameters must always be provided.
If you want to run a puzzle for a day other the the current day or use test data, you will need to pass the parameter in.

```go
// run day XX part 1 using real data
puzzles.Boilerplate.SolvePart1(currentDate, false)


// run day XX part 2 using test data
puzzles.Boilerplate.SolvePart2(currentDate, true)
```

comment out any solvers you do not want to run.


## DataFileReader Interface and description

This Data File Reader is written for AoC and tightly coupled to the project structure. The interface looks like this:

```go
type DataFileReaderParams struct {
	Date        string
	UseTestData bool
	Part        int
	Verbose     bool
}
```

 - It assumes you are creating a data file each day with a specific name format: `dd-MM-yyyy-data.txt` for real data and `dd-MM-yyyy-partX-test-data.txt` for test data (where X is either 1 or 2.) in the `common/data` folder
<br />

 - `date` - The date used to generate the filename in the format `dd-MM-yyyy-data.txt` for production data or `dd-MM-yyyy-partX-test-data.txt` for test data (where X is either 1 or 2.)
<br />

 - `useTestData` - Indicates whether to use test data or real data (this is of course specific to AoC).
 <br />

 - `part` - The part of the puzzle (e.g., 1 or 2).
 <br />

 - `verbose` - Indicates whether to printout console logs or not.
 <br />
